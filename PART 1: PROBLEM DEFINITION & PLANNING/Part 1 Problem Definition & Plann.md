## II. 🩺 Problem Statement  

Over the past 30 years, **diabetes has emerged as a silent global health crisis** — its prevalence continues to rise, while access to effective treatment remains alarmingly low, especially in underserved regions.

In this project, we aim to help decision-makers answer key questions such as:
- 📈 *How has diabetes prevalence evolved over time?*  
- 🚻 *Are there significant gender-based differences in prevalence rates?*  
- ⚠️ *What is the relationship between treatment coverage and risk levels?*  
- 🔮 *What can we predict about future diabetes trends if current patterns persist?*

### 🎯 Big Data Driving Question:  
> *"Can we monitor and analyze global diabetes trends, classify risk levels, and forecast future prevalence to support better healthcare planning?"*
