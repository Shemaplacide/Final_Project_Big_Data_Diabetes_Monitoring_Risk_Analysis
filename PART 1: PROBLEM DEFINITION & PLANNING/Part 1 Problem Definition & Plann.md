## II. Problem Statement
Diabetes prevalence has been increasing steadily worldwide over the past three decades, yet treatment coverage remains low for many populations.  
Decision-makers need clear insights into:  
- How diabetes prevalence changes over time.  
- How gender influences prevalence rates.  
- How treatment coverage relates to diabetes risk levels.  
- How future diabetes prevalence might look if current trends continue.  

**Big Data Question:**  
*“Can we monitor and analyze global diabetes trends, classify risk levels, and forecast future prevalence to support better healthcare planning?”*
