## 1. GitHub Repository

### Objective:
Provide a centralized and well-documented location for all project files.

### Actions Performed:
- **Repository Structure**:
  - **/data**: Contains the raw dataset (`NCD_RisC_Lancet_2024_Diabetes_crude_world.csv`) and cleaned dataset (`Cleaned_Diabetes_World.csv`).
  - **/notebooks**: Includes Jupyter notebooks for Python analysis (data cleaning, EDA, machine learning, and innovation).
  - **/models**: Stores trained machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest and Regression models).
  - **/visualizations**: Contains exported images of Power BI charts and other EDA visuals.
  - **/dashboard**: Includes the Power BI file (`Diabetes_Risk_Analysis.pbix`).
  - **/docs**: Project documentation (markdown reports and exported PDF of the PowerPoint slides).
- **README File**:
  - Provided an overview of the project objective and scope.
  - Included setup instructions for running Python notebooks and loading the Power BI dashboard.
  - Added screenshots of the dashboard and key visualizations for quick preview.
- **Version Control**:
  - Used Git to track changes, ensuring reproducibility and collaboration readiness.

### Outcome:
Anyone accessing the repository can easily:
1. Understand the project objectives.
2. Access data and analysis code.
3. View and interact with the Power BI dashboard.

## 2. PowerPoint Presentation

### Objective:
Communicate project results clearly to stakeholders.

### Actions Performed:
- **Slide Deck Structure**:
  1. **Project Introduction**:
     - Presented the problem context: the global diabetes prevalence challenge and why it matters.
     - Stated the objectives of applying Big Data Analytics.
  2. **Methodology**:
     - Explained dataset selection, Python-based cleaning and analysis steps, and model development.
     - Highlighted Power BI dashboard creation with interactivity and AI-driven visuals.
  3. **Results**:
     - Showed insights from EDA (trends, gender comparisons, treatment coverage analysis).
     - Presented clustering risk levels and prevalence forecasting.
  4. **Recommendations**:
     - Suggested strategies for improving diabetes screening, treatment, and awareness.
     - Emphasized using data-driven monitoring for health policy planning.
  5. **Future Work**:
     - Expand dataset scope to include country-specific socio-economic factors.
     - Integrate additional health indicators (e.g., obesity, hypertension).
     - Enhance models using advanced machine learning techniques.
- **Design Elements**:
  - Used consistent color themes and icons for professional appeal.
  - Integrated visuals from Python (charts) and Power BI (dashboard screenshots).
  - Added minimal text with bullet points to make slides clear and engaging.

### Outcome:
The PowerPoint provides a concise yet comprehensive view of:
- What problem we solved.
- How we solved it (methodology and analytics).
- What insights were gained.
- How those insights can be used for future health planning.
