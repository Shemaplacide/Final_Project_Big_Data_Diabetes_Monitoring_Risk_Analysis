## Welcome & Project Motivation

Diabetes is a global health challenge affecting millions of adults worldwide, leading to serious complications and increased healthcare costs.  
This project leverages **Big Data Analytics** to monitor diabetes prevalence trends, evaluate treatment coverage, classify risk levels, and forecast future patterns.  
The goal is to support **data-driven healthcare decision-making** and help identify key areas where interventions can have the greatest impact.

## Dataset Used

- **cleaned_diabetes_data** and **NCD_RisC_Lancet_2024_Diabetes_crude_world**  
- **Dataset Access Link:** [View Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PYxHFTrmxE-gt9Yaw-heFdWxYCK0k8iO?usp=drive_link)

## Key Definitions

- **Diabetes Prevalence:** Percentage of people in a population who have diabetes at a given point in time.  
  *Why it matters:* Helps assess how widespread diabetes is and monitor progress in controlling it.

- **Treatment Proportion:** Percentage of people with diabetes who are receiving proper treatment.  
  *Why it matters:* Low treatment coverage signals gaps in access to essential care.

- **Year:** The calendar year for which the data was recorded.

- **Diabetes Prevalence Lower CI & Upper CI:** Lower and upper confidence intervals for prevalence, representing the range in which the true value likely falls.

- **Treatment Proportion Lower CI & Upper CI:** Lower and upper confidence intervals for treatment proportion, showing uncertainty in treatment coverage estimates.

- **Risk Label:** A tag indicating whether a record is Low, Medium, or High risk.

- **Risk Cluster:** Groups produced by K-Means clustering based on prevalence and treatment coverage.

- **Age:** Population age category. This dataset uses “Crude” (all ages combined).

## Project Structure

This project is divided into four parts:  
1. Problem Definition & Planning  
2. Python Analytics Tasks  
3. Power BI Dashboard  
4. Submission & Communication

---

## **Part 1: Problem Definition & Planning**

### What We Did
- **Sector Selection:** Focused on the **Health Sector** (Non-Communicable Diseases – Diabetes).  
- **Problem Statement:**  
  *“Can we monitor and analyze global diabetes trends, classify risk levels, and forecast future prevalence to support better healthcare planning?”*  
- **Dataset Identification:**  
  - **Title:** NCD RisC Lancet 2024 – Global Diabetes Crude Prevalence  
  - **Structure:** Structured CSV dataset with 66 rows and 11 columns.  
  - **Status:** Required preprocessing (cleaning and transformations).

---

## **Part 2: Python Analytics Tasks**

### **2.1 Cleaned Dataset**
- Removed empty columns (e.g., `ISO`).  
- Standardized categorical values (`Sex`, `Age`) and corrected data types.  
- Verified and handled outliers.  

**Image – Cleaned Dataset Preview:**

---

### **2.2 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Generated descriptive statistics for prevalence and treatment coverage.  
- Visualized global trends and gender comparisons.  
- Explored multi-variable relationships.

**Image – Correlation Heatmap**  
<img width="341" height="272" alt="Part 2 3 Correlation heatmap – numerical strength of relationships (e g , prevalence vs year)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b60cd041-6ede-49e1-bb37-6353cd350468" />  

**Image – Pairplot**

---

### **2.3 Machine Learning & Clustering**
- **Trained Models (Clustering + Regression):**  
  - **K-Means Clustering:** Segmented risk into Low, Medium, and High.  
  - **Linear Regression:** Predicted diabetes prevalence based on year and gender.  

#### Example Python Code (K-Means)
```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

X = df[['Diabetes_Prevalence','Treatment_Proportion']]
X_scaled = StandardScaler().fit_transform(X)

kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=42)
df['RiskCluster'] = kmeans.fit_predict(X_scaled)
````

#### Example Python Code (Regression)

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

X = df[['Year','Sex_encoded']]
y = df['Diabetes_Prevalence']

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)
y_pred = model.predict(X)
rmse = mean_squared_error(y, y_pred, squared=False)
```

### **2.4 Code Structure & Documentation**

* **Modular Functions** used for cleaning, transformation, and modeling.
* Markdown explanations and inline comments for clarity and reproducibility.

---

### **2.5 Innovation**

* **Random Forest Regressor:** Improved predictive accuracy beyond linear regression.
* **Custom Risk Score:** Combined prevalence and treatment coverage to create a single risk metric.

#### Example Python Code (Random Forest)

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

rf_model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
rf_model.fit(X, y)
importances = rf_model.feature_importances_
```
