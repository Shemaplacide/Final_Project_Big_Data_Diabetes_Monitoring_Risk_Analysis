## 📖 Key Definitions

- **📈 Diabetes Prevalence:** Percentage of people in a population who have diabetes at a given point in time.  
  *Why it matters:* Helps assess how widespread diabetes is and monitor progress in controlling it.

- **💊 Treatment Proportion:** Percentage of people with diabetes who are receiving proper treatment.  
  *Why it matters:* Low treatment coverage signals gaps in access to essential care.

- **📅 Year:** The calendar year for which the data was recorded.

- **🔻 Diabetes Prevalence Lower CI & 🔺 Upper CI:** Confidence intervals showing the possible range of true prevalence.

- **🔻 Treatment Proportion Lower CI & 🔺 Upper CI:** Confidence intervals showing uncertainty in treatment coverage estimates.

- **🏷 Risk Label:** A tag indicating Low, Medium, or High risk.

- **🗂 Risk Cluster:** Groups produced by K-Means clustering based on prevalence and treatment coverage.

- **👥 Age:** Population age category. This dataset uses “Crude” (all ages combined).

### **2.3 Machine Learning & Clustering** 🤖
- **Trained Models (Clustering + Regression):**  
  - **K-Means Clustering:** Segmented risk into Low, Medium, and High.  
  - **Linear Regression:** Predicted diabetes prevalence based on year and gender.  

#### Example Python Code (K-Means)
```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

X = df[['Diabetes_Prevalence','Treatment_Proportion']]
X_scaled = StandardScaler().fit_transform(X)

kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=42)
df['RiskCluster'] = kmeans.fit_predict(X_scaled)
````

#### Example Python Code (Regression)

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

X = df[['Year','Sex_encoded']]
y = df['Diabetes_Prevalence']

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)
y_pred = model.predict(X)
rmse = mean_squared_error(y, y_pred, squared=False)
```

### 🚀 Innovation in Power BI Dashboard

**Feature Used: Smart Narrative (AI Visual)**
Automatically generates **data-driven summaries** of trends and patterns in diabetes prevalence and treatment coverage.

**Why It Matters:**

* Reduces manual explanation
* Helps non-technical users understand insights quickly
* Updates automatically when slicers or filters are changed

**Example Smart Narrative Output:**

> "From 1990 to 2022, diabetes prevalence increased significantly. The year 2022 had the highest recorded prevalence. Males consistently showed higher rates than females. Risk levels shifted from low to high, especially after 2005."
